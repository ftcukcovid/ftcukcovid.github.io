				<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this site is to present information relating to Coronavirus (COVID-19) for people in the United Kingdom to be informed, consider and reduce risk, and help "flatten the curve" nationally. The information below is from authoritative, scientific and government sources and is clearly labelled. Entertainment news is not an authority. Do not share disinformation, unproven claims and hyperbole.</p>

				<h2>Coronavirus is <strong>not the Flu</strong></h2>
				<p>It is important to make clear COVID-19 is not the flu. Its symptoms may be mild for the majority, however, its mortality rate is 3.4% - significantly higher than the 0.1% of seasonal flu (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>). This mortality rate rises to 8-14.8% for elderly patients, increasing with age (<a href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51" target="_blank">Chinese CDC</a>). In addition, the number of patients requiring hospitalisation and specialist treatment in intensive care units (ICU) is high and not comparable to the flu. Italian ICU doctors report 10% of patients require ICU (<a href="https://www.esicm.org/covid-19-update-from-our-colleagues-in-northern-italy/" target="_blank">European Society for Intensive Care Medicine</a>), early reports from China indicated an even higher proportion of 32% during a small study (<a href="thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext" target="_blank">The Lancet</a>). COVID-19 has the capability to overwhelm health services to the point of collapse nation-wide, resulting in significant loss of life across a broad demographic. This has happened in Italy (<a href="https://time.com/5799586/italy-coronavirus-outbreak/" target="_blank">TIME</a>) and China (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-china-health-care-system-under-pressure-in-wuhan.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>).</p>
                <p>With fast, effective testing, planning, isolation and cooperation from the public COVID-19's effects can be minimized by "flattening the curve". South Korea's mortality rate stands at 0.7, significantly lower than the observed rate of 3.4% (<a href="http://m.koreaherald.com/amp/view.php?ud=20200309000327" target="_blank">Korean Herald</a>). The scale of the South Korean testing program has likely contributed to this, with up to 15,000 patients tested per day. The South Korean government took appropriate action early on, and implemented a transparent, accurate information-sharing program with the public, providing digital tools and daily updates (<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/09/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a>). Currently, South Korea's mortality rate is an outlier. Their young population may prove to be the reason it is so low. However, their actions provide a guide.</p>

				<h2>What does "<strong>Flattening the Curve</strong>" mean?</h2>
				<p>Public Health officials and epidemiologists use the term 'flattening the curve' to mean reducing the peak seen in the graph above, representing the number of cases over a period of time. The goal is to delay the number of infections, ideally keeping the peak below the threshold of capacity for national health services. This is critical to ensure the continued operation of health services, saving lives and reducing the overall negative impact on a country. This is in line with the UK's 'Contain. Delay. Research. Mitigate.' strategy (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan/coronavirus-action-plan-a-guide-to-what-you-can-expect-across-the-uk" target="_blank">UK Dept of Health and Social Care</a>).</p>
                
                <p>Your goal is to help reduce the curve to limit the negative effect on you, your family, your friends and the nation. Below are things you can do to help.</p>

				<h2>UK Preparation: <strong>Are we ready</strong>?</h2>
				<p>The United Kingdom has prepared for a national pandemic. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/preparation-and-planning-for-emergencies-responsibilities-of-responder-agencies-and-others" target="_blank">Civil Contingencies Act 2004</a> provides a framework for the UK to plan and respond to emergencies. Local authorities, resilience councils and government entities create plans based on reasonable scenarios to fulfil their statutory duty of care to the public. Public Health England (PHE) published the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pandemic-influenza-response-plan" target="_blank">Pandemic Influenza Response Plan and Strategic Plan</a> in 2014 using evidence-based methodology and lessons learned from H1N1 in 2009. The plans lay out the planning arrangments, including organisation roles, capacity, training, etc for pandemic influenza.</p>
                <p>The UK maintains national stockpiles of facemasks and respirators for health care professionals (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/responding-to-a-uk-flu-pandemic" target="_blank">Department of Health</a>), as well as antivirals and antibiotics (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pandemic-influenza-response-plan" target="_blank">PHE</a>). This does not mean a vaccine is stockpiled. A vaccine is created during the 'Research' phase of the PHE response plan.</p>
                <p>In addition, the UK is home to significant expertise in pharmaceutical and chemical sciences. Porton Down, the Defense Science Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and PHE laboratory (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28773174" target="_blank">BBC News</a>), and the UK is home to multinational pharmaceutical companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline, who are contributing to the effort against COVID-19 (<a href="https://www.gsk.com/" target="_blank">GSK</a>). The UK formerly hosted the headquarters of the <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en" target="_blank">EU Medicine Agency</a> until March 2019 (<a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/about-us/brexit-united-kingdoms-withdrawal-european-union" target="_blank">EMA</a>).</p>

				<h2>UK Preparation: <strong>How have we responded</strong>?</h2>
				<p>The UK is actively testing individuals who suspect they may have COVID-19, allowing them to self-isolate and receive treatment if required. As of March 11th 27,476 people have been tested, 456 return positive results while the remaining 27,020 returned negative results. Six people have died (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200311014403/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public" target="_blank">Gov.uk via archive.org</a>). For up to date information see this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public">UK Gov page</a>. Testing is a critical element to pandemic response, it allows resources to be directed and plans to move through their designated phases.</p>
                <p>The UK has responded well to COVID-19 as of March 10th. The number of infections is much lower than regional neighbours France (1,784), Germany (1,565) and Spain (1,695), and significantly lower than Italy (10,149). The UK is on par with the number of infected in Sweden (355) and the Netherlands (382), and the UK has more infections than Belgium (267) and Denmark (262) (<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>). These number were accurate as of March 10th.</p>
                <p>Prof Chris Whitty, Cheif Medical Officer of England, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the governments Cheif Scientific Advisor, have stated the governments' response is evidence-based and proportionate (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51796072" target="_blank">BBC News</a>). Some experts believe advice should change regarding encouraging working from home and the reduction of large-scale events. William Hanage, an epidemiologist from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health said, "Everyone who can work from home should work from home,”, “The most important thing is that even if it won’t protect you entirely, it will delay you getting infected. And if we can ‘flatten the curve’ we will avoid the worst consequences for healthcare services". The government is currently resisting implementing difficult measures due to the publics inevitable fatigue if asked make drastic changes and due to the economic impact (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/people-should-work-from-home-to-tackle-coronavirus-spread" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>). Public health officials have stated this may become necessary in 10-14 days (as of March 10) as the situation progresses (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51812326" target="_blank">BBC News</a>).</p>
                <p>However, the UK government has received criticism. Elisabeth Braw, a resilience expert from the Royal United Services (RUSI) criticised the handling of information to the public, “...there a fundamental problem in that the UK has not focused on preparedness among the public. The government may consider itself to be prepared but it’s not the case that the public is. Otherwise you end up with frantic last-minute efforts and the public are stockpiling toilet paper and other resources.” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/pressure-builds-on-uk-to-step-up-coronavirus-measures" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>). Stockpiling and reactionary measures, rather than preparedness, were perhaps inevitable due to hyperbolic and sensationalist stories from entertainment newspapers.</p>

				<h2>How long <strong>will Coronavirus last</strong>?</h2>
				<p>COVID-19 will not be over quickly. Coronavirus was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11th (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51839944" target="_blank">BBC News</a>), and is still spreading around the world. However, the UKs appropriate and science-based approach means it is well placed to deal with the length of the global outbreak and seasonal reoccurrence.</p>
                <p>According to predictive models, the <em>global</em> peak will likely occur in winter 2020-21 (<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-worldwide-peak-will-come-next-winter-scientific-model-predicts-11954441" target="_blank">Sky News</a>). This does not refer to the end of the outbreak. In the UK specifically, PHE officials believe the number of infections will peak by late March 2020 (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-uk-cases-symptoms-death-toll-epidemic-covid-19-a9390241.html target="_blank"">The Independent</a>). Prof Chris Whitty, Cheif Medical Officer of England said, "We are now very close to the time, probably within the next 10 to 14 days, when the modelling would imply we should move to a situation where everybody with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self-isolating for a period of seven days." The public following recommended actions, particularly self-isolation and hand washing, will ensure the number of infections peaks soon and stays low.</p>
                <p>A vaccine for COVOD-19 is under development by a number of nations, including the UK, US and China. Currently, there is no vaccine which is effective for Coronavirus. It took 20 months for a SARS vaccine to be created in 2003, by 2015 a vaccine for Zika virus was created within 6 months (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html#vaccine" target="_blank">New York Times</a>). The time will vary depending on a number of factors, however, it will be months before a vaccine is created to eliminate Coronavirus and stop seasonal reoccurrence. More time will be required to mass-produce the vaccine (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51665497" target="_blank">BBC News</a>).</p>
                <p>Following public health advice ensures the number of cases stays low, controlling the national situation, allowing time for a vaccine to be created and avoiding a situation similar to Italy and China.</p>

                <h3>Wash your hands</h3>
                <p>Wash your hands often for 20 seconds. Wash your hands when you get home or into work.</p>
                <h3>Catch sneezes and coughs</h3>
                <p>Catch sneezes and coughs in a tissue or sleeve - not your hands.</p>
                <h3>Avoid contact</h3>
                <p>Avoid contact with people who are unwell.</p>
                <h3>Change your greeting habits</h3>
                <p>Don't shake hands. Consider other non-contact greetings.</p>
                <h3>Work from home</h3>
                <p>William Hanage, an epidemiologist from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health suggest working from home, "Everyone who can work from home should work from home,” “The most important thing is that even if it won’t protect you entirely, it will delay you getting infected. And if we can ‘flatten the curve’ we will avoid the worst consequences for healthcare services".</p>
                <h3>Consider neighbours and the elderly</h3>
                <p>People aged 60 and above are the most at risk. Consider things you can do to help them reduce their risk. Wash your hands before you come in contact with anyone over 60.</p>
                <h3>For employers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure managers know how to spot the symptoms of COVID019.</li>
                    <li>Ensure employee contact information is up to date.</li>
                    <li>Ensure frequently touched objects are disinfected regularly.</li>
                    <li>Consider supplying hand sanitizer to staff with regular public contact.</li>
                    <li>Allow employees with vulnerable dependants or cohabitants to work from home to avoid infection early.</li>
                    <li>Allow employees with preexisting conditions to work from home.</li>
                    <li>If those with preexisting conditions cannot work from home, plans should be in place for their risk to be mitigated should the situation worsen.</li>
                </ul>

				<h2>What <strong>should you NOT you do?</strong></h2>
                <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/" target="_blank">NHS COVID-19 Advice</a> | <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-employees-employers-and-businesses" target="_blank">UK Government COVID-19 advice</a>
				<h3>Don't panic</h3>
                <p>There is no reason to panic in the United Kingdom. Well-thought-out plans have been enacted and respected professionals state the response has been appropriate and science-based. This is backed up by the relatively low number of infections.</p>
                <h3>Don't stockpile</h3>
                <p>Do not stockpile. This creates panic and reduces supply to those that need the items. Individuals with specific needs may need to stockpile particular items as a risk mitigation technique. Stockpiling soap reduces the supply for everyone when hand washing is a crucial action to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>
                <h3>Don't be complacent</h3>
                <p>Stating that Coronavirus is similar to the flu harms public health efforts as the incorrect notion spreads within the population and results in people not following advice. This results in increased infection and consequences for everyone.</p>
                <h3>Consider your travel arrangements</h3>
                <p>Check refund policies and cancel early. Consider your ability to move freely. Holidaymakers recently made it to Italy, but their movements became severely restricted once a nation-wide quarantine was implemented. If you choose to travel remember you are a vector who can pass on an illness which kills, follow public health advice. </p>
