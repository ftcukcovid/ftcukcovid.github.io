				<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this site is to present information relating to Coronavirus (COVID-19) for people in the United Kingdom to be informed, consider and reduce risk, and help "flatten the curve" nationally. The information below is from authoritative, scientific and government sources and is clearly labelled. Entertainment news is not an authority. Do not share disinformation, unproven claims and hyperbole.</p>

				<h2>Coronavirus is <strong>not the Flu</strong></h2>
				<p>It is important to make clear COVID-19 is not the flu. Its symptoms may be mild for the majority, however, its mortality rate is 3.4% - significantly higher than the 0.1% of seasonal flu (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>). This mortality rate rises to 8-14.8% for elderly patients, increasing with age (<a href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51" target="_blank">Chinese CDC</a>). In addition, the number of patients requiring hospitalisation and specialist treatment in intensive care units (ICU) is high and not comparable to the flu. Italian ICU doctors report 10% of patients require ICU (<a href="https://www.esicm.org/covid-19-update-from-our-colleagues-in-northern-italy/" target="_blank">European Society for Intensive Care Medicine</a>), early reports from China indicated an even higher proportion of 32% during a small study (<a href="thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext" target="_blank">The Lancet</a>). COVID-19 has the capability to overwhelm health services to the point of collapse nation-wide, resulting in significant loss of life across a broad demographic.</p>
                <p>The UK has so-far avoided the worst cast scenario, however, deaths have far surpassed the initially predicted 20,000 (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/67e6a4ee-3d05-43bc-ba03-e239799fa6ab">Financial Times</a>). More on this in the appropraite section below.</p>

				<h2>What does "<strong>Flattening the Curve</strong>" mean?</h2>
				<p>Public Health officials and epidemiologists use the term 'flattening the curve' to mean reducing the peak seen in the graph above, representing the number of cases over a period of time. The goal is to delay the number of infections, ideally keeping the peak below the threshold of capacity for national health services. This is critical to ensure the continued operation of health services, saving lives and reducing the overall negative impact on a country. This is in line with the UK's 'Contain. Delay. Research. Mitigate.' strategy (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan/coronavirus-action-plan-a-guide-to-what-you-can-expect-across-the-uk" target="_blank">UK Dept of Health and Social Care</a>).</p>
                
                <p>Your goal is to help reduce the curve to limit the negative effect on you, your family, your friends and the nation. Below are things you can do to help.</p>

				<h2>UK Preparation: <strong>Are we ready</strong>?</h2>
				<p>The United Kingdom prepared for a national pandemic. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/preparation-and-planning-for-emergencies-responsibilities-of-responder-agencies-and-others" target="_blank">Civil Contingencies Act 2004</a> provides a framework for the UK to plan and respond to emergencies. Local authorities, resilience councils and government entities create plans based on reasonable scenarios to fulfil their statutory duty of care to the public. Public Health England (PHE) published the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pandemic-influenza-response-plan" target="_blank">Pandemic Influenza Response Plan and Strategic Plan</a> in 2014 using evidence-based methodology and lessons learned from H1N1 in 2009. The plans lay out the planning arrangments, including organisation roles, capacity, training, etc for pandemic influenza.</p>
                <p>The UK maintains national stockpiles of facemasks and respirators for health care professionals (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/responding-to-a-uk-flu-pandemic" target="_blank">Department of Health</a>), as well as antivirals and antibiotics (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pandemic-influenza-response-plan" target="_blank">PHE</a>). This does not mean a vaccine is stockpiled. A vaccine is created during the 'Research' phase of the PHE response plan.</p>
                <p>In addition, the UK is home to significant expertise in pharmaceutical and chemical sciences. Porton Down, the Defense Science Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and PHE laboratory (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28773174" target="_blank">BBC News</a>), and the UK is home to multinational pharmaceutical companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline, who are contributing to the effort against COVID-19 (<a href="https://www.gsk.com/" target="_blank">GSK</a>). The UK formerly hosted the headquarters of the <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en" target="_blank">EU Medicine Agency</a> until March 2019 (<a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/about-us/brexit-united-kingdoms-withdrawal-european-union" target="_blank">EMA</a>). Companies throughout the UK are turning production to help combat COVID-19 (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51896168">BBC News</a>).</p>

				<h2>UK Preparation: <strong>How have we responded</strong>?</h2>
                <p>As of April 23rd the UK has tested 411,192 people for COVID-19, 133,495 of these were positive, with the remaining 277,697 confirmed virus free. 18,100 people have died within hospital according to daily figures.(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public" target="_blank">Gov.uk via archive.org</a>). The Office of National Statistics release data which includes deaths outside of hospitals, their data suggests up to 41,000 people have died (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases">Office of National Statistics</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/67e6a4ee-3d05-43bc-ba03-e239799fa6ab">Financial Times</a>). Government officials and advisors have stated the numbers they read out suffer from "lag" and only include deaths within hospitals. However, the scale of the difference surprised many.</p>
                <p>For up to date information see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public">UK Gov</a> and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases">Office of National Statistics</a>.</p>
                <p>The UK is on track to be the worst affected nation in Europe, despite initial lower infection rates than regional neighbours, such as France and Germany (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/uk-will-be-europes-worst-hit-by-coronavirus-study-predicts">The Guardian</a>, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-uk-could-be-worst-affected-country-in-europe-11972251">Sky News</a>). The UK has implemented a nation-wide lockdown, which will be in place for a significant period of time. This decision was taken when it was most appropraite, according to the government and its advisors. This was due to the significance of the request, fear of non-complance and future complacency (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51812326" target="_blank">BBC News</a>).</p>
                
                <p>The UK government has received immense criticism recently. Elisabeth Braw, a resilience expert from the Royal United Services (RUSI) criticised the handling of information to the public, “...there a fundamental problem in that the UK has not focused on preparedness among the public. The government may consider itself to be prepared but it’s not the case that the public is. Otherwise you end up with frantic last-minute efforts and the public are stockpiling toilet paper and other resources.” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/pressure-builds-on-uk-to-step-up-coronavirus-measures" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>). Stockpiling and reactionary measures, rather than preparedness, were perhaps inevitable due to hyperbolic and sensationalist stories from entertainment newspapers.</p>
                
                <p>More significantly, the govenment have been questioned on delays to the sourcing of personal protective equiptment (PPE) and lack of interest in joining EU schemes to source equiptment, including ventilators (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f9051f66-cfbe-4b36-848e-3980225ae542">Financial Times</a>), choosing to build such items from scratch instead (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coroanvirus-uk-government-missing-ppe-offers-slow-response-covid-2020-4?r=US&IR=T">Business Insider</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/58f5f476-7a85-4785-81bd-0806ff7c6ded">Financial Times</a>).</p>
                <p>The government has on a number of occasions missed self-imposed deadlines to increase testing (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df7ddb5b-0fd8-43a0-b6e3-2e0e21b0a024">Financial Times</a>). In March testing was limited testing only those who are already in hospital. This is of concern as testing is a critical element to pandemic response, and large-scale mass testing will allow the UK to ease lockdown restrictions. The decision has been made due to the lack of labratory capacity (<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/coronavirus-testing-uk">Wired UK</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d4bce150-84a3-11ea-b872-8db45d5f6714">Financial Times</a>).</p>

				<h2>How long <strong>will Coronavirus last</strong>?</h2>
				<p>COVID-19 will not be over quickly. Coronavirus was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11th (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51839944" target="_blank">BBC News</a>), global cases passed 2 million on April 14th (<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-covid-19-cases-worldwide-top-two-million-11972846">Sky News</a>) and it is still spreading around the world.</p>
                
                <p>According to predictive models, the <em>global</em> peak will likely occur in winter 2020-21 (<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-worldwide-peak-will-come-next-winter-scientific-model-predicts-11954441" target="_blank">Sky News</a>). This does not refer to the end of the outbreak. In the UK specifically, Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, announced on April 22nd that the UK has passed its peak. (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/uk-has-reached-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-matt-hancock">The Guardian</a>).</p>
                <p>This does not mean the UK will end its lockdown, or that the threat from COVID-19 is over. Chris Whitty stated on the same day that UK restrictions are unlikely to be completely gone this calander year (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-52391061/coronavirus-easing-restrictions-will-take-a-long-time">BBC News</a>).</p>
                <p>A vaccine for COVOD-19 is under development by a number of nations, including the UK, US and China. Currently, there is no vaccine which is effective for Coronavirus. It took 20 months for a SARS vaccine to be created in 2003, by 2015 a vaccine for Zika virus was created within 6 months (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html#vaccine" target="_blank">New York Times</a>). The time will vary depending on a number of factors, however, it will be many months before a vaccine is created to eliminate Coronavirus and stop seasonal reoccurrence. More time will be required to mass-produce the vaccine (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51665497" target="_blank">BBC News</a>).</p>
                <p>Following public health advice ensures the number of cases stays low, controlling the national situation, allowing time for a vaccine to be created and avoiding a situation similar to Italy and China.</p>

                <h3>Wash your hands</h3>
                <p>Wash your hands often for 20 seconds. Wash your hands when you get home or into work.</p>
                <h3>Catch sneezes and coughs</h3>
                <p>Catch sneezes and coughs in a tissue or sleeve - not your hands.</p>
                <h3>Avoid contact</h3>
                <p>Avoid contact with people who are unwell.</p>
                <h3>Change your greeting habits</h3>
                <p>Don't shake hands. Consider other non-contact greetings.</p>
                <h3>Consider neighbours and the elderly</h3>
                <p>People aged 60 and above are the most at risk. Consider things you can do to help them reduce their risk. Wash your hands before you come in contact with anyone over 60.</p>
                <h3>For employers (of essential workers)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure managers know how to spot the symptoms of COVID019.</li>
                    <li>Ensure employee contact information is up to date.</li>
                    <li>Ensure frequently touched objects are disinfected regularly.</li>
                    <li>Consider supplying hand sanitizer to staff with regular public contact.</li>
                    <li>Allow employees with vulnerable dependants or cohabitants to work from home to avoid infection early.</li>
                    <li>Allow employees with preexisting conditions to work from home.</li>
                    <li>If those with preexisting conditions cannot work from home, plans should be in place for their risk to be mitigated should the situation worsen.</li>
                </ul>

				<h3>Don't panic</h3>
                <p>There is no reason to panic in the United Kingdom. Well-thought-out plans have been enacted and respected professionals state the response has been appropriate and science-based. This is backed up by the relatively low number of infections.</p>
                <h3>Don't stockpile</h3>
                <p>Do not stockpile. This creates panic and reduces supply to those that need the items. Individuals with specific needs may need to stockpile particular items as a risk mitigation technique. Stockpiling soap reduces the supply for everyone when hand washing is a crucial action to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>
                <h3>Don't be complacent</h3>
                <p>Stating that Coronavirus is similar to the flu harms public health efforts as the incorrect notion spreads within the population and results in people not following advice. This results in increased infection and consequences for everyone.</p>
